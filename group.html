                Our team was named “George is the new Jesus” and consisted of 3 people, Haydn, Rasul and Kyle.  Kyle was the managing forefront of the team, taking the lead on the project and making sure we all stayed on track. Rasul was the minutes meeting writer, reporting on each meeting we had as a team collectively to keep track of what we already had and hadn’t done. Haydn was the content writer and the tester, testing the website to make sure that it ran as it was supposed to and testing the other pages too, looking out for any errors that needed to be fixed.</dd>
            <li>What we did as a team</li>
            <dd>As a team, we built our sound detector project with a rasberry pi pico. We also built a website for our project consisting of 3 pages. A homepage, another about our team and a third about our project</dd>
